/**
 * The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
 * programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
 * [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
 *
 * - Simple to use and understand for most users
 * - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
 *
 * # Overview
 *
 * The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
 * and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
 * [google.rpc.Code][google.rpc.Code], but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
 * error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
 * developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
 * error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
 * localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
 * information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
 * in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
 *
 * # Language mapping
 *
 * The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
 * is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
 * exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
 * mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
 * in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
 *
 * # Other uses
 *
 * The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
 * environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
 * consistent developer experience across different environments.
 *
 * Example uses of this error model include:
 *
 * - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
 *     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
 *     errors.
 *
 * - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
 *     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
 *
 * - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
 *     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
 *     each error sub-response.
 *
 * - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
 *     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
 *     represented directly using the `Status` message.
 *
 * - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
 *     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
